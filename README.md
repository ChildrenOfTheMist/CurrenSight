# CurrenSight: Peso Banknote Detector for the Visually Impaired

The main objective of this project is to build a mobile application that will aid visually impaired individuals to recognize and distinguish Philippine currency notes. Aside from the peso banknotes, the feature for distinguishing their play money counterpart was also included.

This repository is created in order to release the application in the public, reaching those who are in need. Aside from reaching users, another aim of this release is to help, inspire, and encourage researchers, as well as future researchers, to pursue, and enhance the project.
